## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-23

### Added

- Recipe `fullpage` option to control whether recipes take a full page or can flow naturally
  - When `fullpage=true` (default): Recipes display images and clear the page after completion
  - When `fullpage=false`: Recipes do not display images and do not force a page break, allowing compact recipes to appear on the same page or flow naturally
- Recipe `clearpageafter` option to control page breaks after recipes
  - When `clearpageafter=true` (default): Forces a page break after the recipe
  - When `clearpageafter=false`: No page break after the recipe, allowing content to flow naturally
  - Only effective when `fullpage=true`; automatically set to `false` when `fullpage=false`
  - Useful for adding compact recipes after long full-page recipes that span multiple pages

### Fixed

- Fixed recipenote counter not persisting between ingredients and instructions sections

## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-19

### Added

- Recipe notes system with `\note{...}` command for adding contextual notes to ingredients and instructions
- Automatic note numbering and collection at the bottom of recipes
- Customizable "Notes" label via `\setTextNotes{<text>}` command

### Fixed

- Fixed tag duplicate checking to prevent duplicate tags when explicitly added tags match auto-generated tags (e.g., `spicy={yes}` and `tags={Spicy}`)

## [1.1.1] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed

- Debug mode (`bleed=debug`) to visualize trim and bleed boundaries with colored lines
- Margin customization commands: `\setmargintop`, `\setmarginbottom`, `\setmarginleft`, `\setmarginright`
- Bleed value customization via `\setbleedvalue{<length>}`
- Gutter margin support via `\setguttermargin{<length>}` for binding offset in two-sided printing
- Programmatic bleed control via `\enablebleed[<length>]` command

### Changed

- All page types (cover, preface, chapter, image, recipe, back cover) now extend content into bleed area when enabled
- Page number boxes automatically adjust position based on bleed settings
- Geometry package configuration now properly distinguishes between two-sided (inner/outer) and one-sided (left/right) margins
- Image positioning calculations updated to account for bleed extensions

### Notes
