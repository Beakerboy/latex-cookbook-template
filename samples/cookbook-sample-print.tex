	title={Preface},
	text={Welcome to this collection of recipes, gathered from three generations of family cooking and culinary adventures around the world. Each recipe tells a story—some passed down through handwritten notes on yellowed paper, others discovered during travels through bustling markets and quiet countryside kitchens.\newline

	This cookbook is more than just a collection of instructions and ingredients. It's a celebration of the joy that comes from creating something delicious, the warmth of sharing a meal with loved ones, and the memories that form around the dinner table. From simple weekday breakfasts to elaborate weekend feasts, these recipes have been tested, adjusted, and perfected over countless meals.\newline

	Whether you're a beginner just learning your way around the kitchen or an experienced cook looking for new inspiration, I hope these recipes bring as much happiness to your table as they have brought to ours. Don't be afraid to make them your own—the best recipes are the ones that evolve with each telling.\newline

	Happy cooking!},

			\ingredient{2 medium-to-large ripe bananas\note{The riper the bananas, the sweeter the pancakes will be. Look for bananas with brown spots on the peel.}}
			\ingredient{4 large eggs}
			\ingredient{1/2 cup whole wheat flour or buckwheat flour or 2/3 cup oat flour\note{For a gluten-free option, use buckwheat or oat flour. The texture will be slightly different but equally delicious.}}
			\ingredient{Optional flavor/nutrition boosters: ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, up to 2 tablespoons hemp hearts and/or ground flaxseed, up to ¼ teaspoon salt}
			\ingredient{Butter, avocado oil or ghee, for cooking\note{Ghee provides a rich, buttery flavor without burning as easily as regular butter.}}
		},
	instructions ={
			\instruction{In a medium mixing bowl, mash the banana with a large fork until it's shiny and mostly smooth. Add the eggs and whisk until the eggs are evenly incorporated into the banana.}
			\instruction{Add the flour and any optional boosters. Gently stir until combined. Set aside while you preheat the skillet (the batter can rest for up to 1 hour if need be).}
			\instruction{Heat a large skillet (stainless steel, cast iron or nonstick) over medium-low heat (if using an electric griddle, heat it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit). You're ready to start cooking pancakes once a drop of water sizzles on contact with the hot surface. If necessary, lightly oil the cooking surface with a pat of butter or oil, carefully wiping up excess with a paper towel (nonstick surfaces likely won't require any oil).}
			\instruction{Scoop ¼ cup batter onto the hot skillet, leaving a couple of inches around each pancake for expansion. Cook until small bubbles form on the surface of the pancakes, 2 to 3 minutes.\note{Don't flip too early! Wait until you see bubbles forming on the surface, which indicates the bottom is cooked.}}
			\instruction{Flip the pancakes, then cook until lightly golden on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more butter and dialing down the heat if the pancakes are turning dark on the outside before they are cooked through on the inside.\note{If pancakes are browning too quickly, reduce the heat slightly. The goal is a golden-brown exterior with a fully cooked interior.}}
			\instruction{Serve immediately or keep warm in a 200 degree Fahrenheit oven. Leftover pancakes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or frozen for up to 3 months. To reheat, stack leftover pancakes and wrap them in a paper towel before gently reheating in the microwave.}
